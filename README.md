Set up simple html project

Build html project consisting of several pages, each page of the document aside from the index.html reflects a single recipe.

To do this, use the knowledge of very basic html writing while using multiple commits to build and exercise further familiarity with Git and GitHub.

First commit

Add basic html for index and recipes

Built index html and full Lasagna page. Other recipes still just a copy and paste of Lasagna and links not yet added to index page. Forgot to commit earlier modifications so this is the first.
